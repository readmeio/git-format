Why hello there! 👋

This is a reference implementation of ReadMe's Git-based documentation format. It shows what the file and folder structure looks like when syncing your docs with ReadMe via Git.

Not everything here is set in stone. We use this repo to try out new things and see how they feel! If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to [open an Issue or PR](https://github.com/readmeio/git-format/issues/new). We'd love your feedback!
