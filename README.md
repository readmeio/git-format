Why hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Shhh, don't tell anyone... but we're rewriting ReadMe to be built on Git! This is a reference implementation of the format, so you can get a feel for how it will work.

Not everything here is set in stone... we use this repo to try out new things and see how they feel! If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an Issue or PR. We'd love your feedback!

And lastly, if you want to try out our Git system as early as possible, email alpha@readme.io!
